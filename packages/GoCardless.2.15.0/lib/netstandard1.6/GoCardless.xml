             Represents a creditor resource.
            
             Each [payment](#core-endpoints-payments) taken through the API is linked
             to a "creditor", to whom the payment is then paid out. In most cases
             your organisation will have a single "creditor", but the API also
             supports collecting payments on behalf of others.
             
             Please get in touch if you wish to use this endpoint. Currently, for
             Anti Money Laundering reasons, any creditors you add must be directly
             related to your organisation.

             Represents a mandate import resource.
            
             Mandate Imports allow you to migrate existing mandates from other
             providers into the
             GoCardless platform.
             
             The process is as follows:
             
               1. [Create a mandate
             import](#mandate-imports-create-a-new-mandate-import)
               2. [Add entries](#mandate-import-entries-add-a-mandate-import-entry)
             to the import
               3. [Submit](#mandate-imports-submit-a-mandate-import) the import
               4. Wait until a member of the GoCardless team approves the import, at
             which point the mandates will be created
               5. [Link up the
             mandates](#mandate-import-entries-list-all-mandate-import-entries) in
             your system
             
             When you add entries to your mandate import, they are not turned into
             actual mandates
             until the mandate import is submitted by you via the API, and then
             processed by a member
             of the GoCardless team. When that happens, a mandate will be created for
             each entry in the import.
             
             We will issue a `mandate_created` webhook for each entry, which will be
             the same as the webhooks
             triggered when [ creating a mandate ](#mandates-create-a-mandate) using
             the mandates API. Once these
             webhooks start arriving, any reconciliation can now be accomplished by
             [checking the current status](#mandate-imports-get-a-mandate-import) of
             the mandate import and
             [linking up the mandates to your
             system](#mandate-import-entries-list-all-mandate-import-entries).
             
             <p class="notice">Note that all Mandate Imports have an upper limit of
             30,000 entries, so
             we recommend you split your import into several smaller imports if
             you're planning to
             exceed this threshold.</p>

             Represents a mandate import entry resource.
            
             Mandate Import Entries are added to a [Mandate
             Import](#core-endpoints-mandate-imports).
             Each entry corresponds to one mandate to be imported into GoCardless.
             
             To import a mandate you will need:
             <ol>
               <li>Identifying information about the customer (name/company and
             address)</li>
               <li>Bank account details, consisting of an account holder name and
                  either an IBAN or <a href="#appendix-local-bank-details">local bank
             details</a></li>
               <li>Amendment details (SEPA only)</li>
             </ol>
             
             We suggest you provide a `record_identifier` (which is unique within the
             context of a
             single mandate import) to help you to identify mandates that have been
             created once the
             import has been processed by GoCardless. You can
             [list the mandate import
             entries](#mandate-import-entries-list-all-mandate-import-entries),
             match them up in your system using the `record_identifier`, and look at
             the `links`
             fields to find the mandate, customer and customer bank account that have
             been imported.

             Represents a payout item resource.
            
             When we collect a payment on your behalf, we add the money you've
             collected to your
             GoCardless balance, minus any fees paid. Periodically (usually every
             working day),
             we take any positive balance in your GoCardless account, and pay it out
             to your
             nominated bank account.
             
             Other actions in your GoCardless account can also affect your balance.
             For example,
             if a customer charges back a payment, we'll deduct the payment's amount
             from your
             balance, but add any fees you paid for that payment back to your
             balance.
             
             The Payout Items API allows you to view, on a per-payout basis, the
             credit and debit

             Represents a redirect flow resource.
            
             Redirect flows enable you to use GoCardless' [hosted payment
             pages](https://pay-sandbox.gocardless.com/AL000000AKFPFF) to set up
             mandates with your customers. These pages are fully compliant and have
             been translated into Danish, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Norwegian,
             Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish and Swedish.
             
             The overall flow is:
             
             1. You [create](#redirect-flows-create-a-redirect-flow) a redirect flow
             for your customer, and redirect them to the returned redirect url, e.g.
             `https://pay.gocardless.com/flow/RE123`.
             
             2. Your customer supplies their name, email, address, and bank account
             details, and submits the form. This securely stores their details, and
             redirects them back to your `success_redirect_url` with
             `redirect_flow_id=RE123` in the querystring.
             
             3. You [complete](#redirect-flows-complete-a-redirect-flow) the redirect
             flow, which creates a [customer](#core-endpoints-customers), [customer
             bank account](#core-endpoints-customer-bank-accounts), and
             [mandate](#core-endpoints-mandates), and returns the ID of the mandate.
             You may wish to create a [subscription](#core-endpoints-subscriptions)
             or [payment](#core-endpoints-payments) at this point.
             
             Once you have [completed](#redirect-flows-complete-a-redirect-flow) the
             redirect flow via the API, you should display a confirmation page to
             your customer, confirming that their Direct Debit has been set up. You
             can build your own page, or redirect to the one we provide in the
             `confirmation_url` attribute of the redirect flow.
             
             Redirect flows expire 30 minutes after they are first created. You
             cannot complete an expired redirect flow.

            successfully. Only returned once the customer has set up their
            mandate via the payment pages and the redirect flow has been
            [completed](#redirect-flows-complete-a-redirect-flow), and only
            available for 15 minutes from when you complete the redirect flow.
            The structure of this URL may change at any time, so you should read

             ### Recurrence Rules
             
             The following rules apply when specifying recurrence:
             
             - The first payment must be charged within 1 year.
             - When neither `month` nor `day_of_month` are present, the subscription
             will recur from the `start_date` based on the `interval_unit`.
             - If `month` or `day_of_month` are present, the recurrence rules will be
             applied from the `start_date`, and the following validations apply:
             
             | interval_unit   | month                                          |
             day_of_month                            |
             | :-------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
             :-------------------------------------- |

             ### Rolling dates
             
             When a charge date falls on a non-business day, one of two things will
             happen:
             
             - if the recurrence rule specified `-1` as the `day_of_month`, the
             charge date will be rolled __backwards__ to the previous business day
             (i.e., the last working day of the month).
             - otherwise the charge date will be rolled __forwards__ to the next
             business day.

             Creditor Bank Accounts hold the bank details of a
             [creditor](#core-endpoints-creditors). These are the bank accounts which
             your [payouts](#core-endpoints-payouts) will be sent to.
             
             Note that creditor bank accounts must be unique, and so you will
             encounter a `bank_account_exists` error if you try to create a duplicate
             bank account. You may wish to handle this by updating the existing
             record instead, the ID of which will be provided as
             `links[creditor_bank_account]` in the error response.

             Each [payment](#core-endpoints-payments) taken through the API is linked
             to a "creditor", to whom the payment is then paid out. In most cases
             your organisation will have a single "creditor", but the API also
             supports collecting payments on behalf of others.
             
             Please get in touch if you wish to use this endpoint. Currently, for
             Anti Money Laundering reasons, any creditors you add must be directly

             Customer Bank Accounts hold the bank details of a
             [customer](#core-endpoints-customers). They always belong to a
             [customer](#core-endpoints-customers), and may be linked to several
             Direct Debit [mandates](#core-endpoints-mandates).
             
             Note that customer bank accounts must be unique, and so you will
             encounter a `bank_account_exists` error if you try to create a duplicate
             bank account. You may wish to handle this by updating the existing
             record instead, the ID of which will be provided as
             `links[customer_bank_account]` in the error response.

             Customer Notifications represent the notification which is due to be
             sent to a customer
             after an event has happened. The event, the resource and the customer to

             Note that these are ephemeral records - once the notification has been
             actioned in some
             way, it is no longer visible using this API.

             Service class for working with mandate import entry resources.
            
             Mandate Import Entries are added to a [Mandate
             Import](#core-endpoints-mandate-imports).
             Each entry corresponds to one mandate to be imported into GoCardless.
             
             To import a mandate you will need:
             <ol>
               <li>Identifying information about the customer (name/company and
             address)</li>
               <li>Bank account details, consisting of an account holder name and
                  either an IBAN or <a href="#appendix-local-bank-details">local bank
             details</a></li>
               <li>Amendment details (SEPA only)</li>
             </ol>
             
             We suggest you provide a `record_identifier` (which is unique within the
             context of a
             single mandate import) to help you to identify mandates that have been
             created once the
             import has been processed by GoCardless. You can
             [list the mandate import
             entries](#mandate-import-entries-list-all-mandate-import-entries),
             match them up in your system using the `record_identifier`, and look at
             the `links`
             fields to find the mandate, customer and customer bank account that have
             been imported.

             Mandate Imports allow you to migrate existing mandates from other
             providers into the
             GoCardless platform.
             
             The process is as follows:
             
               1. [Create a mandate
             import](#mandate-imports-create-a-new-mandate-import)
               2. [Add entries](#mandate-import-entries-add-a-mandate-import-entry)
             to the import
               3. [Submit](#mandate-imports-submit-a-mandate-import) the import
               4. Wait until a member of the GoCardless team approves the import, at
             which point the mandates will be created
               5. [Link up the
             mandates](#mandate-import-entries-list-all-mandate-import-entries) in
             your system
             
             When you add entries to your mandate import, they are not turned into
             actual mandates
             until the mandate import is submitted by you via the API, and then
             processed by a member
             of the GoCardless team. When that happens, a mandate will be created for
             each entry in the import.
             
             We will issue a `mandate_created` webhook for each entry, which will be
             the same as the webhooks
             triggered when [ creating a mandate ](#mandates-create-a-mandate) using
             the mandates API. Once these
             webhooks start arriving, any reconciliation can now be accomplished by
             [checking the current status](#mandate-imports-get-a-mandate-import) of
             the mandate import and
             [linking up the mandates to your
             system](#mandate-import-entries-list-all-mandate-import-entries).
             
             <p class="notice">Note that all Mandate Imports have an upper limit of
             30,000 entries, so
             we recommend you split your import into several smaller imports if
             you're planning to
             exceed this threshold.</p>

             Service class for working with payout item resources.
            
             When we collect a payment on your behalf, we add the money you've
             collected to your
             GoCardless balance, minus any fees paid. Periodically (usually every
             working day),
             we take any positive balance in your GoCardless account, and pay it out
             to your
             nominated bank account.
             
             Other actions in your GoCardless account can also affect your balance.
             For example,
             if a customer charges back a payment, we'll deduct the payment's amount
             from your
             balance, but add any fees you paid for that payment back to your
             balance.
             
             The Payout Items API allows you to view, on a per-payout basis, the
             credit and debit
             items that make up that payout's amount.

             Service class for working with redirect flow resources.
            
             Redirect flows enable you to use GoCardless' [hosted payment
             pages](https://pay-sandbox.gocardless.com/AL000000AKFPFF) to set up
             mandates with your customers. These pages are fully compliant and have
             been translated into Danish, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Norwegian,
             Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish and Swedish.
             
             The overall flow is:
             
             1. You [create](#redirect-flows-create-a-redirect-flow) a redirect flow
             for your customer, and redirect them to the returned redirect url, e.g.
             `https://pay.gocardless.com/flow/RE123`.
             
             2. Your customer supplies their name, email, address, and bank account
             details, and submits the form. This securely stores their details, and
             redirects them back to your `success_redirect_url` with
             `redirect_flow_id=RE123` in the querystring.
             
             3. You [complete](#redirect-flows-complete-a-redirect-flow) the redirect
             flow, which creates a [customer](#core-endpoints-customers), [customer
             bank account](#core-endpoints-customer-bank-accounts), and
             [mandate](#core-endpoints-mandates), and returns the ID of the mandate.
             You may wish to create a [subscription](#core-endpoints-subscriptions)
             or [payment](#core-endpoints-payments) at this point.
             
             Once you have [completed](#redirect-flows-complete-a-redirect-flow) the
             redirect flow via the API, you should display a confirmation page to
             your customer, confirming that their Direct Debit has been set up. You
             can build your own page, or redirect to the one we provide in the
             `confirmation_url` attribute of the redirect flow.
             
             Redirect flows expire 30 minutes after they are first created. You
             cannot complete an expired redirect flow.

             will recur from the `start_date` based on the `interval_unit`.

             ### Rolling dates
             
             When a charge date falls on a non-business day, one of two things will
             happen:
             
             - if the recurrence rule specified `-1` as the `day_of_month`, the
             charge date will be rolled __backwards__ to the previous business day
             (i.e., the last working day of the month).
             - otherwise the charge date will be rolled __forwards__ to the next
             business day.
